    <h1>JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
    <p>JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
        Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
        often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
        the code on users' devices.</p>
    <h2>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT JAVASCRIPT</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
        event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
        for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
        (DOM).</p>
    <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
    <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
        variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
